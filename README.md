# Catalogue

Spring 2019

This socialized book review/catalogue is an extension of my culminating project in ICS3U. The website served as a database of books within my high school's library. To promote the use of the underutilized library resources, I decided to add features to this personal catalogue that would incite more social interaction that one would expect on a typical book catalogue. The site would facilitate direct and post-style communication of recommendations, reviews, updates, messages, and more.
 
Using a foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the main pages of the site allow for optimized searches based on title, author, category, or rating. By implementing backend databases, including FireBase, I enabled login functionality linked to student accounts ranging from school to Google to even other social media platforms. Once logged in, users have access to a greater variety of services, including direct messaging, adding 'friends', leaving book reviews, filtering viewed posts, sharing recommendations, and being displayed on leaderboards for school-verified reading lists.

In the future, I hope to return to this site and further optimize it with my new skills. Specifically, I hope to improve the website's appearance, data-based customization, and filtering systems.
